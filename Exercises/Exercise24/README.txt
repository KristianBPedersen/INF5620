My username at UIO is kristibp and I worked alone for this project. The code can be found in vertical_motion.py and the math can be found in O1.pdf. 

Some of the code for this project is a bit rough. I did not realize until I was almost done that I had to add support for non-constant source terms. The code runs and passes all the tests, but at some points it is a bit unintuitive, inefficient and chaotic.
